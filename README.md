# From Flying Balls to Colliding Polygons

## Poster

This repo contains the poster used at the thesis defense of my bachelor project
at Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana (USI) during my third year as a Computer
Science bachelor student.

The final version of the poster can be found [here](poster.pdf). It describes
broadly the different phases through which I went during the project. For a
more detailed report, check out my thesis report [here](https://github.com/karma-riuk/bachelor-project-report/blob/main/bachelorproject.pdf)
(the repository that contains the report is [karma-riuk/bachelor-project-report](https://github.com/karma-riuk/bachelor-project-report)).
